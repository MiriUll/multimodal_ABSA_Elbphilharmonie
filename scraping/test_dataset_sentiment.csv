On Sunday we had the opportunity to see Hamburg from the water with a friend. It was really great to see everything from the boat. Especially since the port of Flensburg is a bit smaller. #boot #meer #wasser #hamburg #hh #hafen #sonne #kran #schiff #speicherstadt #elbe #br√ºcken #elbphilharmonie #schumacherphotography #meineperle,positive
